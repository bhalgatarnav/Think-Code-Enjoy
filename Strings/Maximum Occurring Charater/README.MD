The string will contain only ASCIl characters, from the ranges ('a'-'z', 'A-Z', '0'-'9'), and case matters. 
If there is a tie in the maximum number of times a character appears in the string, return the character that appears first in the string•
* Example
* text = abbbaacc
* Both 'a' and 'b' occur 3 times in text. Since 'a' occurs earlier, a is the answer.
